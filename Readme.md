Embedded Applications

In this project, I attempt to build/set around the TI MSP432 board a number of peripheral with emphasis on IoT:
 - TI CC3100
 - ESP8266
 - DHT11
 - LDC 16x2
 - Quade.

The purpose is to have hands on to embedded applications just for fun!
The project is in progress ..............
